                The Takahe is a rare, large bird that lives in New Zealand. It has beautiful blue and green feathers and a big, strong red beak. For a long time, people thought the Takahe was extinct until it was rediscovered in 1948, hiding in the mountains of Fiordland. Takahe birds can’t fly, so they walk around in grassy areas searching for plants to eat. They are shy and careful, but sometimes they come out for visitors to see in special nature reserves where they are protected. The Takahe is a unique bird that shows how special and surprising New Zealand’s wildlife can be.
