                The Kea is a big, clever parrot that lives in the mountains of New Zealand. It has green feathers and bright orange under its wings, making it look beautiful when it flies. Keas are playful and curious birds, known for being like clowns of the mountains. They love to explore and sometimes play tricks, like picking at cars or backpacks to see what's inside. Keas are very smart and often work together in groups to solve puzzles and find food.

        <div class="text-box">
            At Arthurs Pass National Park in New Zealand, you can find the Kea in its natural home. This mountain park is full of rocky peaks, forests, and snowy areas where the Kea loves to explore. These playful parrots are often seen flying around or hopping on the ground, looking for food and playing with anything that catches their eye. Visitors to Arthurs Pass sometimes get to see the Kea up close, especially around parking lots where the birds curiously investigate cars and bags. The park is a special place for the Kea, as it provides the perfect mix of high-altitude trees and open spaces they need to live and have fun.
